title: "About Me"
---

It's hard to sum up my research interests with a catchy one liner, but the common thread is the importance of deep and authentic cross-disciplinary dialogues, both across scientific disciplines, as well as between scientists and non-scientists.

I've spent most of my life sitting on the line between science and the public. Pre-academia, I was an educator and trail guide at the wonderful [Roaring Brook Nature Center](https://www.roaringbrook.org/), where I was able to get involved in wildlife conservation, education, and rehabilitation from a young age. This was also the beginning of my obsession with macro photography, especially dragonflies.

I carried this fascination with nature through my undergraduate education where I was able to participate in Northeastern University's [Three Seas program](https://cos.northeastern.edu/marine-environmental-sciences/three-seas/). This was a life-changing experience, and the intense focus on SCUBA diving opened my eyes to the world beneath the waves. After Three Seas, I remained at the MSC and contributed to several projects investigating the impacts of the invasive red alga *Dasysiphonia japonica*.

Following Three Seas, I also had the opportunity to complete a co-op at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the [Anderson Harmful Algal Bloom lab](https://www2.whoi.edu/site/andersonlab/) where I got some (to put it lightly) hands-on experience with the more technical side of research. My work at WHOI was mainly focused on the early detection of harmful algal blooms (HABS) in the Gulf of Maine via a network of instruments called [Environmental Sample Processors](ESPs).(https://northeasthab.whoi.edu/bloom-monitoring/environmental-sample-processor/). I assisted with the mission programming, maintainence, and deployment of these sensors and was able to see first-hand how modern data streams are transforming the way we learn about the world around us.

My current work at UMass Boston is mostly focused on the [Floating Forests](www.floatingforests.org) citizen science kelp mapping project, although I have found ways to include myself in a plethora of fieldwork and other projects as well. Throughout my contributions to this Floating Forests, I have had the opportunity to work with other ecologists, remote sensing specialists, education researchers, teachers, students, web designers, and machine learning experts - the list is very long, apologies if I left anyone out! Check out my [Projects and Publications](projects_and_publications.qmd) page for more details on Floating Forests, as well as some of the other things I have been involved with at UMass!
